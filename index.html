REAL THOUGHTS:
-Lots of people say "great job" on this whole baby thing, even to me, and I don't quite get it. Even "congratulations" is kinda confusing. People should be holding their congrats for when she's 18 and she got accepted to Harvard with a full ride scholarship. 
-And I like the bottle feeding. Then I get to do something beside change diapers. Plus, we know how much she's getting and that feels way better.
-We decided to give the hep-b shot after a month instead of the first day and we got asked about it every day we were at the hospital and just today at the doctors office they made us sign something. They don't ask WHY we don't want to give the shot but they make you feel guilty anyway and treat you like a Jenny McCarthy loon.  

-Embrie latched on fine the first 2 days but we didn't know if she was getting anything and it was hard to get her to latch on "right" (i.e. without causing pain). The high bilirubin levels COULD be because we didn't feed her enough those first few days. And there is nothing worse than feeling responsible for your child's pain. A friend suggested we ask for the pump right away because you get a lot of free attachments for the pump that come in handy. I didn't remember until the pediatrician was suggesting we supplement the baby with formula. Once she had 2-3 bottles it was all over . . . now she screams when we try anything else. We're going to a lactation specialist tomorrow but I don't think it'll do any good. Pumping and bottling is a lot of work but it's gotta be cheaper than formula, right?

POST SOON:
-Walking around in public with her makes me feel like a rockstar! So many people "recognize" us and want to talk and ask questions and compliment out looks.
-When you let her cry she looks INCREDABLY sad and it's there is an overwhelming need to go and pick her up. And even when you do pick her up she's still mad and cries when she looks at you.

-Four months: she makes me smile every day. When she sees me she lights up and I can't help but grab her.

-So many times I heard that when I had a child I would "find Jesus". So far all I find are signs of evolution. The latest example is how she drinks water . . . she laps it up like a dog.

BEST RESPONSES:

TO JENNI FOR BLOG:
You might have said I would want things to change but if you did . . . it wasn't loud enough for me to actually hear it. If anything the ringing of "your life is over" made it so I couldn't hear anything else.

That's why I wish people would just shut the hell up sometimes. It's a balancing act for sure. I could also see myself saying "why didn't you say something!" too. But another thing I'm going to put into the blog someday is that I intentionally don't and haven't read baby books about when she'll crawl or roll over or walk or anything like that. I do want to know about teething because, well, that's something we have to take into consideration when she's cranky and seems to be in pain. And it's good to know when a good time to have her eat foods. But, again, it's a balancing act. I mean, even with the food I think it's obvious to start feeding her around RIGHT NOW because she's looking at me eat in a way that makes me think she wants some. Same with drinking out of a cup . . the way she looks at me and grabs for the cup is a good indication that I should give her a nib (and I have . . . it's funny how her "instinct" is to lap at it like a dog). 

All I know is I can't wait for someone to say something like "Oh, my kid started walking at 9 months!" because I have a great response ready. "One uppers" are the worst (and I have to admit that I do the one upper thing myself sometimes).

<h3>2013/01/01: HAPPY NEW YEAR!</h3>

<h3>11/26: Embrie's first words!</h3>
<p>It's been awhile! I need to write more often so I can look back on this and remember the good times. Before I know it she'll be a teenager and is about to move out with her looser boyfriend. Anyway . . . . </p>
<p>On most nights around the time Embrie starts to get fussy or 9pm, whichever comes first, it's time to take a bath and get ready for bed. Embrie LOVES bathtime. Now that she's older she sits up and plays where her bath toys while the water is running and will do that for 20-30 minutes. Ever since before she was allowed in the tub she's been in the bathtub almost every night (I guess newborns are not supposed to take baths because of water getting into their undeveloped ears). After the bath I wrap her in a towel and she  moves her arms and looks like a bat to me so I started singing the "Batman!" song to her. She doesn't move her arms like a bat anymore but the song stuck. "Na na na na na na na na na na na na BATMAN! BATMAN! BATMAN! BATMAAAAAAN!"</p>
<p>This past Sunday night I put her in the towel and started singing the song like I have for the past 7 months or so (she's almost 8 months now!) and she was shaking her head (I shake my head back and forth during the na na na na part) and then when I stopped to say "BATMAN!" she also said Batman! I couldn't believe it. So I started again and she did it again! I tried to call Sarah in and show her but she was busy. And of course, Embrie wouldn't do a repeat performance no mater how many times we sung the song while Mommy was looking. </p>
<p>I know I don't have evidence or proof but that's how these things go. Anyway, mark it down . . . her first word was BATMAN.</p>
