REAL THOUGHTS:
-The philosophy of yes

-Lots of people say "great job" on this whole baby thing, even to me, and I don't quite get it. Even "congratulations" is kinda confusing. People should be holding their congrats for when she's 18 and she got accepted to Harvard with a full ride scholarship. 
-And I like the bottle feeding. Then I get to do something beside change diapers. Plus, we know how much she's getting and that feels way better.
-We decided to give the hep-b shot after a month instead of the first day and we got asked about it every day we were at the hospital and just today at the doctors office they made us sign something. They don't ask WHY we don't want to give the shot but they make you feel guilty anyway and treat you like a Jenny McCarthy loon.  

-Embrie latched on fine the first 2 days but we didn't know if she was getting anything and it was hard to get her to latch on "right" (i.e. without causing pain). The high bilirubin levels COULD be because we didn't feed her enough those first few days. And there is nothing worse than feeling responsible for your child's pain. A friend suggested we ask for the pump right away because you get a lot of free attachments for the pump that come in handy. I didn't remember until the pediatrician was suggesting we supplement the baby with formula. Once she had 2-3 bottles it was all over . . . now she screams when we try anything else. We're going to a lactation specialist tomorrow but I don't think it'll do any good. Pumping and bottling is a lot of work but it's gotta be cheaper than formula, right?

POST SOON:
-Walking around in public with her makes me feel like a rockstar! So many people "recognize" us and want to talk and ask questions and compliment out looks.
-When you let her cry she looks INCREDABLY sad and it's there is an overwhelming need to go and pick her up. And even when you do pick her up she's still mad and cries when she looks at you.

-Four months: she makes me smile every day. When she sees me she lights up and I can't help but grab her.

-So many times I heard that when I had a child I would "find Jesus". So far all I find are signs of evolution. The latest example is how she drinks water . . . she laps it up like a dog.

BEST RESPONSES:

TO JENNI FOR BLOG:
You might have said I would want things to change but if you did . . . it wasn't loud enough for me to actually hear it. If anything the ringing of "your life is over" made it so I couldn't hear anything else.

That's why I wish people would just shut the hell up sometimes. It's a balancing act for sure. I could also see myself saying "why didn't you say something!" too. But another thing I'm going to put into the blog someday is that I intentionally don't and haven't read baby books about when she'll crawl or roll over or walk or anything like that. I do want to know about teething because, well, that's something we have to take into consideration when she's cranky and seems to be in pain. And it's good to know when a good time to have her eat foods. But, again, it's a balancing act. I mean, even with the food I think it's obvious to start feeding her around RIGHT NOW because she's looking at me eat in a way that makes me think she wants some. Same with drinking out of a cup . . the way she looks at me and grabs for the cup is a good indication that I should give her a nib (and I have . . . it's funny how her "instinct" is to lap at it like a dog). 

All I know is I can't wait for someone to say something like "Oh, my kid started walking at 9 months!" because I have a great response ready. "One uppers" are the worst (and I have to admit that I do the one upper thing myself sometimes).

<h3>RIP Johnny. This is how I'll always remember you. </h3>
<p>
2014-09-27: Until Sarah and I had this child I never saw much humanity in you . . . all you ever did was complain and that's as nice as I can say it. But when Embrie arrived I saw another side to you.  You were gentle and attentive and kind and never complained . . . even about parenting style which I was sure you would give me an earful about. Embrie lit you up in a way I never saw before. And when I think you won't be a part of her life I get emotional. Today at your memorial Embrie noticed the image of you on the big screen and the one of you in a suit at the front of the room. She pointed and said something (probably "papa" ten times over). I'm sure she wondered where you were. I have no idea what to tell her. I can't tell her you are in heaven and I can't say you are in a better place. And then I get angry. And I think about what you would do and say if the situation was reversed and you and Sarah found me lying on the floor in front of the TV in the living room. You'd be angry too. Furious. So I guess we have that in common.  Hopefully forgiveness is something we have in common too.
