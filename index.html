REAL THOUGHTS:
-Lots of people say "great job" on this whole baby thing, even to me, and I don't quite get it. Even "congratulations" is kinda confusing. People should be holding their congrats for when she's 18 and she got accepted to Harvard with a full ride scholarship. 
-And I like the bottle feeding. Then I get to do something beside change diapers. Plus, we know how much she's getting and that feels way better.
-We decided to give the hep-b shot after a month instead of the first day and we got asked about it every day we were at the hospital and just today at the doctors office they made us sign something. They don't ask WHY we don't want to give the shot but they make you feel guilty anyway and treat you like a Jenny McCarthy loon.  

-Embrie latched on fine the first 2 days but we didn't know if she was getting anything and it was hard to get her to latch on "right" (i.e. without causing pain). The high bilirubin levels COULD be because we didn't feed her enough those first few days. And there is nothing worse than feeling responsible for your child's pain. A friend suggested we ask for the pump right away because you get a lot of free attachments for the pump that come in handy. I didn't remember until the pediatrician was suggesting we supplement the baby with formula. Once she had 2-3 bottles it was all over . . . now she screams when we try anything else. We're going to a lactation specialist tomorrow but I don't think it'll do any good. Pumping and bottling is a lot of work but it's gotta be cheaper than formula, right?

POST SOON:
-Walking around in public with her makes me feel like a rockstar! So many people "recognize" us and want to talk and ask questions and compliment out looks.
-When you let her cry she looks INCREDABLY sad and it's there is an overwhelming need to go and pick her up. And even when you do pick her up she's still mad and cries when she looks at you.

-Four months: she makes me smile every day. When she sees me she lights up and I can't help but grab her.

-So many times I heard that when I had a child I would "find Jesus". So far all I find are signs of evolution. The latest example is how she drinks water . . . she laps it up like a dog.

BEST RESPONSES:

TO JENNI FOR BLOG:
You might have said I would want things to change but if you did . . . it wasn't loud enough for me to actually hear it. If anything the ringing of "your life is over" made it so I couldn't hear anything else.

That's why I wish people would just shut the hell up sometimes. It's a balancing act for sure. I could also see myself saying "why didn't you say something!" too. But another thing I'm going to put into the blog someday is that I intentionally don't and haven't read baby books about when she'll crawl or roll over or walk or anything like that. I do want to know about teething because, well, that's something we have to take into consideration when she's cranky and seems to be in pain. And it's good to know when a good time to have her eat foods. But, again, it's a balancing act. I mean, even with the food I think it's obvious to start feeding her around RIGHT NOW because she's looking at me eat in a way that makes me think she wants some. Same with drinking out of a cup . . the way she looks at me and grabs for the cup is a good indication that I should give her a nib (and I have . . . it's funny how her "instinct" is to lap at it like a dog). 

All I know is I can't wait for someone to say something like "Oh, my kid started walking at 9 months!" because I have a great response ready. "One uppers" are the worst (and I have to admit that I do the one upper thing myself sometimes).

<h3>11/26: Embrie's first words!</h3>
<p>It's been awhile! I need to write more often so I can look back on this and remember the good times. Before I know it she'll be a teenager and is about to move out with her looser boyfriend. Anyway . . . . </p>
<p>On most nights around the time Embrie starts to get fussy or 9pm, whichever comes first, it's time to take a bath and get ready for bed. Embrie LOVES bathtime. Now that she's older she sits up and plays where her bath toys while the water is running and will do that for 20-30 minutes. Ever since before she was allowed in the tub she's been in the bathtub almost every night (I guess newborns are not supposed to take baths because of water getting into their undeveloped ears). After the bath I wrap her in a towel and she  moves her arms and looks like a bat to me so I started singing the "Batman!" song to her. She doesn't move her arms like a bat anymore but the song stuck. "Na na na na na na na na na na na na BATMAN! BATMAN! BATMAN! BATMAAAAAAN!"</p>
<p>This past Sunday night I put her in the towel and started singing the song like I have for the past 7 months or so (she's almost 8 months now!) and she was shaking her head (I shake my head back and forth during the na na na na part) and then when I stopped to say "BATMAN!" she also said Batman! I couldn't believe it. So I started again and she did it again! I tried to call Sarah in and show her but she was busy. And of course, Embrie wouldn't do a repeat performance no mater how many times we sung the song while Mommy was looking. </p>
<p>I know I don't have evidence or proof but that's how these things go. Anyway, mark it down . . . her first word was BATMAN.</p>

<h3>9/11: Great image of the new WTC.</h3>
<p>Even though Embrie wasn't alive I sure hope we can make sure she's aware and never forgets.</p>


<h3>8/19: out in the forest: Embrie's first camping trip!</h3>
<p>She did well on the 4 hour drive up with just one break in the middle. She was fussy but Sarah was able to calm her down for the entire drive (not so lucky on the way back . . . she cried for almost an hour). It was down to 50 Fahrenheit (10 Celsius) and Sarah had her all bundled up and she slept PEACEFULLY from about 10pm to 6am every night. She still took naps but she was up for most of the day. I took her on walks around the forest and she watched Walnut dart back and forth trying to pick up the scent of a chipmunk or squirrel.  Actually, we were out too much because she got a little sunburn on her face (but not in her eyes since she had little sunglasses on most of the time).  Grandma East (Martha to you!) spent time with the baby and even got her to sleep once! The time went fast and there wasn't as much time for sorting through pictures as I thought but I promise more are coming soon. </p>

<h3>8/10, 3pm: Four month checkup! She's doing great and is at about 14 pounds and 26 inches long! </h3>
<p>She had more shots and we were nervous because last time she cried for AT LEAST 30 minutes straight. This time she cried for about 30 seconds and then just wimpered a little and then it was like nothing happened. </p>


<h3>Thoughts after one month.</h3>
<p>I wanted to post this about 3 months ago but when I told a friend it was suggested I keep this to myself. Even now, more than 3 months later I don't regret how I felt and in fact I know it's not uncommon after talking to other parents.</p>

<p>It's been a month so here is an update. When Embrie was born I thought there was something wrong. In my first glimpse she was gray and upside down and bloated and she was wiggling like she was a rubber doll. Yes, a rubber doll. I was really scared. That was after 4 hours of torture (for Sarah of course but it's not easy seeing it happen either) and it was 4 in the morning but still, I was scared. The doctor and everyone else in the room was saying Embrie was fine . . . even perfect. They wiped away the gray goo and I saw a little baby (with a slightly distorted head which also made me scared her brain was mush after seeing the doctor pry on her head like that). Okay, so I've established I was scared for my daughter's well being. But I didn't feel like she was my daughter. She was an alien to me (and she kinda looked like one too but no one will say that).</p>

<p>The first few hours were the worst. I didn't feel connected to her and in fact, kept thinking "the nightmare begins". In the first few days all she did really was cry, eat, sleep, cry, eat, sleep. I felt an OVERWHELMING sense of responsibility. I was changing diapers and feeding and burping and walking her because she was my responsibility. I didn't really want to do any of those things. I wasn't unhappy or mad but that's just because it was something I was expecting. But, again, it was out of a sense of OVERWHELMING responsibility.</p>

<p>After a few weeks things were changing for me. Out of all the advice I heard (like "your live is over", "forever changed", "relationship will never be the same") no one once mentioned that I would WANT things to change. And now, a month later, I don't mind doing any of those things and in fact I can't wait to see her. She still mostly just eats and sleeps but when she's awake she jiggles her head and body in a way that charms me. I always want to film it because I know it won't last long but it never works out holding a baby and a camera at the same time. Every day I love her more and more and it's not about responsibility anymore. It took a month but I finally got there. And thank goodness for the paternity program at ASU . . . they give up to 6 weeks off for "bonding time" and it's a big deal and a rare benefit that most Americans don't get and I'm incredibly grateful.</p>

<h3>Friday June 16th, 4:38pm: 2 month checkup! Actually it's been 10 weeks now. She weighed in at 12 pounds, 1 ounce and, well, I don't remember the length.</h3><p> She got 5 shots today and one oral vaccine and now she is all caught up on immunizations.  She cried for about 15 minutes and then she calmed down and then she cried again the whole way home. But then she went to sleep and has been sleeping since. If she is fussy or has a fever we're supposed to give her acetaminophen (no ibuprofen until 6 months) but we might give it to her anyway just to calm down the parents!

<h3>Tuesday, June 12th, noon: Rob is back home but still not back to 100% (or as 100% as a guy in his late 80's can be!). There was talk of a pacemaker?? Mmmm. </h3>

<h3>Tuesday, June 5th, noon: Rob is feeling better but is still at the hospital. No word on the results of the MRI from yesterday.</h3>

<h3>Sunday, June 3rd, 5:30pm: Paramedics arrive and take Rob back to the hospital.</h3>

<p>At about 4pm Rob was feeling lightheaded.  Joan tested his pulse and blood pressure and asked a million questions.  Dinner had arrived and he insisted everyone go and eat but no one wanted to leave him alone of course.  Soon his speech was slurred and Joan was on the line with the hospital. I talked to Rob and asked if he felt any pain but he said there was no pain just a pressure in his head and the room was spinning. At first he said he didn't want to go back to the hospital but at this point he said he should go back. By then the ambulance was already on the way.</p>


<h3>Saturday, June 2nd, 6:42pm: We left the house at 11pm yesterday, flew out at 1am, got into Charlotte at 8am, flew out of there at 9:30am, arrived in Buffalo at 11am, left there at noon, and arrived at the hospital at 2:30pm to greet geegee and geepee (great grandma/pa). </h3>

<p>
	It all started with a call on Friday around 10am from Sarah where she cries as she tells me her grandpa had a stroke. We talked about what we could do to get to Toronto. We couldn't fly there because we didn't have a passport for Embrie yet and we didn't have a birth certificate because we sent that off to get the passport.  But we had to try. So Sarah confirmed we could get across the border by land with a birth certificate and I was sure we could get another one.  And around 1:30pm we did get a new one. 	I made up my mind right then we should go. My thoughts were we HAD to go because we wanted to be able to say to Embrie that she met her Great Grandpa.  
</p>
<p>
	So Sarah called her work to see if she could fly while being on FMLA leave and when her boss heard the circumstances not only was she cleared to fly she got "positive space" tickets which meant we were not on standby.  I can't express how incredibly grateful we are for those tickets. 
</p>

<!--
<p>
	That morning all the information we has was that he had a stroke and was going to be in the hospital for 5 days at least. By later in the  afternoon we were hearing that he was transfered from the "stroke hospital" to the regular hospital close to their house.  And by the evening we were hearing he could be heading home. 
</p>
-->

<h3>Friday, May 11th, 8:00pm: Embrie has been fussy for most of today and yesterday and she's not sleeping more then an hour at a time. She's always had her fussy time every day but it's been fussy DAYS! Hopefully she'll be happier tomorrow. </h3>

<p>Today we went for an adventure ride to Charles Pabst Studio and she decided it was time for some number 2. First diaper change on the road in the car! Should have taken pictures of that one because it was hilarious. Oh, and for my readers . . . keep reading for a secret link! <a href="http://www.ssmcgee.com/index-video.php">Click here!</a></p>

<h3>Wednesday, April 18th, 1:40pm, Day 12: Yesterday we were worried because Embrie hadn't gone #2 in three days</h3>

<p>  . . . so we "took her temperature" if you know what I mean. That worked well and if she ever seems too fussy and it's been several days the doctor said it's common. Today, at the doctor she was weighed again and went from 7 pounds 14 ounces to 8 pounds 7.5 ounces . . . so she gained back her birth weight and then some in less than two weeks. Good to know we are not underfeeding her! Her belly button is bleeding a little and has scabbed again. I think what the doctor did last time by ripping the cord off is he pulled off the scab and it wasn't ready so it scabbed again.</p>


<h3>Sunday, April 15th, 11:44am, Day 9: Another day another bath for Embrie but today I didn't take any pictures. Next time for sure. Hopefully soon she can take a real bath instead of a sponge bath.</h3>

<h3>4/14 4:18pm: We have received a TON of feedback from the registration page and from emails and text messages and facebook and even twitter and it's all been great. Thanks! </h3>

<p>Here is my favorite response from Karen, my former boss at ASU: ". . . she's precious and I can tell she's already thinking about how cool Google and gmail are!!!"  I'll post about my favorite parenting advice from the registration form later so get those suggestions in soon.</p>

<h3>4/14 sometime in the morning: The girls (mom, grandma) wanted me to mark the milestone of the Embrie rolling to her side and scooting herself to one side of her bed. I probably should have told them I didn't put her in the middle of the bed in the first place.</h3>

<img src="/baby/1SleepingInNewOufitAfterShopping.jpg" />
<h3>4/11 2:22pm: Tuckered out after all that shopping! (All we got was a breast pump. Tip for expectant moms . . . just get the Medela. The Lansinoh is half the price but, because of the design, the diaphragm is a part of what needs to be cleaned after each use and if they are not completely dry before use the machine is useless. . . and towel dry isn't dry enough . . . and that's just my suspicion . . . we were not the only ones that only got it to work once.)</h3>

<img src="/baby/3DoctorWhoRippedOffCord.jpg" />
<h3>4/11 11:15am: Last moments before her cord gets ripped off. He really did seem nice and he was spouting all kinds of stats like "60% of 
white kids have this birth mark behind their head and for 40% it doesn't go away" . . . but I wish instead of those stats he would have 
said he was going to tear off the coord.</h3>

<h3>4/11 11:17am: The doctors decides it's time for her cord to come off so he rips it off. Yeah, we weren't happy about it either. Embrie 
didn't cry so it wasn't so bad but still . . . why not mention something before you go tearing things off my baby, you know?</h3>

<h3>4/11 11:11am: At the doctor and she weighs 7 pounds 14 ounces! But, according to the doctor, this is a different scale so we can only 
count this relative to her future visits. Apparently measuring weight isn't an 
exact science (and I'm scared to learn that).</h3>

<h3>4/10 12:25pm: We're home! Pictures comming soon of her in the car seat.</h3>

<h3>4/10 Noon: We're heading home!</h3>

<h3>4/10 11:40am: Heading to the nursery to get training on how to use the billy blanket. End up check out and taking the LoJack off of Embrie. She's ours now!</h3>

<h3>Tuesday, April 10th, 10:00am, Day 4 (5 nights spent at the hospital, 6th day here): We get the news that we are going home for sure! Her weight is 7 pounds, 
10 ounces and her bilirubin is 8.7. Low enough that we can go home with a billy blanket.</h3>

<h3>4/9 9:49pm: Now she weighs 7 pounds 10 ounces so she's gone up a little! And her bilirubin is down to 9.3 and the peditrician 
lowered the light treatment to the billy blanket down from the "full billy" (a light under her and over her). Chances are good we are 
heading home tomorrow morning.</h3>

<h3>4/9 8:30pm: No new news . . . still waiting to hear what her latest bilirubin levels are. But here are a few images by special 
request. (You know who you are.)</h3>

<img src="/baby/AlreadySelfSufficient.jpg" />
<h3>4/9 6:40pm: Already self-sufficient! FYI: We are still trying nibs but we are supplementing with "cow nibs". And Sarah is pumping and 
we're seeing milk now. Sometimes Embrie is so hysterical when she gets to us that we HAVE to give her a bottle . . . not to 
mention that we only have 30 minutes to feed her. Having "bottled nibs" ready is handy for speed. Oh, and plenty of food and 
therefor doodies means her levels will go down faster.</h3>

<img src="/baby/CloseUp5.jpg" />
<h3>4/9 6:41pm: Close-up of the self sufficiency (trying to zoom in enough to cut out those nasty velcro strips)</h3>


<h3>Monday, April 9th, 1:55pm, Day 3 (4 nights spent at the hospital, 5th day here): Her levels went from 13 to 11 but it's not low enough 
to release her so we'll be here one more day at least. Happy to get to see her every 3 hours since we get to stay at the hospital but, 
of course, it would 
be much better if we could go home. Hopefully tomorrow. She's not around much and she has those tabs on the side of her head and she's 
mostly just feeding so there are not many chances for pictures. </h3>

<h3>4/8 9:44pm: Bad news. Her counts went UP slightly instead of down so she's in for the night for sure and probably until late in the 
afternoon tomorrow. This light treatment is certainly taking away the yellow color but it feels as if they are throwing on a coat 
of pink/red paint instead of fixing the real problem.</h3>

<h3>4/8 7:44pm: Check out all those images! Most from today but a few from yesterday. One more update today when we hear something.</h3>

<h3>4/8 6:43pm: Yeah, she just went back for another treatment. When we hear what her levels are I'll update.</h3>

<h3>4/8 6:24pm: We are still waiting for her test to come back to see if the two treatments lowered her levels enough so that we could go home 
(and make sure to take her outside in the sun). Right now she's just nibbing. We think she's going back for one more treatment 
at least since we won't know the results of the test until after the next treatment is supposed to start. I would probalby know 
I if I was paying better attention and not writing in here all the time!</h3>

<h3>4/8 1:30pm: We got good news in that we get to stay here with Embrie-Lynn today in the "nesting room". We still don't get to see her much 
because she has to go in for treatment for 2.5 hours every 3 hours. Not sure if that goes though the night or if it's just 
until 6pm tonight.</h3>

<h3>4/8 12:50pm: Sarah and I went to lunch while Embrie was off to treatment. We were sitting down in the cafeteria and I looked down to open 
up Sarah's salad and once I get it open I look up to see her crying. 
So I say "Oh, did you want to open the salad?" She laughed and the tears went away . . . for a while.</h3>

<h3>Sunday, April 8th, 12:01pm, Day 2: Today her bilirubin was high (13 whatevers) so that means she's jaundice. She does 
look a bit yellow. Right now she is getting some kind of light therapy for 2.5 hours, then she feeds, and then 2.5 hours of therapy again. 
The REALLY BAD news is that chances are she will need to stay overnight. And by "she" that means the baby and not us. Sometimes 
they give people a "nesting room" but not always. If not, we'll be leaving home without the baby or just hanging out at the 
cafeteria.</h3>

<h3>4/7 11:05pm: Today we were concerned if Embrie had urinated or not since we've never seen the diapers change color (the aides 
and nurses told us over and over about the blue stripe we would see). Sarah decided to 
wake her for a feeding since it was more than 3 hours since she last ate and she was moving around a little anyway. 
The best way to REALLY wake her is to change her diaper 
so that's what Sarah did and as usual there was a decent amount of #2 in there. Sarah was wiping and I was helping with "resources" 
and it was getting complicated because she wasn't finished with #2. Embrie also sent a clear message that she had no 
problem with #1 either. Lets just say we had to change all the bed sheets!</h3>

when contractions start! If you notice anything wrong let me know.</h3>

<h3>4/7 3:57pm: Sarah reminded me that I never mentioned the fees! It's $50 to hold the baby for 5 minutes and you have to be 18 or older 
and free of disease (so that's a "no" to you Josh on both counts). If you want a picture it's 
another $20 and if it's a good one I'll publish it here. Imagine the publicity! We had 63 unique visitors yesterday!</h3>

<h3>4/7 3:42pm: A few have complained (not just you Crystal!) that I never "opened it back up to visitors". I was mostly talking about 
yesterday because we were so tired! But it has been nice that the number of visitors has been low so that Sarah gets time to rest 
and figure out how to give the baby some nibs without worrying about people waiting outside for her. So yes, please stop by! But send me 
a txt so I can give you the room number. And come hungry because the cafeteria food is great and not too expensive.</h3>

<h3>4/7 2:16pm: Amanda gets to hold the baby finally (after 2 hours of waiting!)</h3>


<h3>4/7 2:43pm: She's been sleeping since about 11:45am and we THOUGHT it might be time to feed her again around 2:15pm so we woke her 
up so Amanda could hold her . . . but turns out she wasn't hungry at all. Now she's asleep again. 
Now I really AM going to post some new pictures!</h3>

<h3>4/7 11:27am: Lactation specialist gave us some good tips and Embrie WAS hungry. Been feeding without pain for 15 minutes. And now she's 
so tired you lift her arm and it falls like a wet noodle (a good sign she's relaxed).</h3>

<h3>4/7 10:32am: Happy 5th Wedding Anniversary to us! </h3>

<h3>Saturday, April 7th, 10:19am, Day 1: She passed her hearing test! Real exciting, eh?  Just one of the 100 distractions when the baby is sleeping and fine and when she's crying and we don't know what to do it's as if they know to stay away. She seems to want to "nib" a lot and we can't tell if she's getting anything. Time for the "lactation specialist". New pictures coming soon. She already looks different.
</h3>

<h3>4/6 8:08pm: Technically, when Embrie was born she weighed 7 pounds 15.7 ounces but they round up that ".7" so that's why she was 8 pounds exactly. Now she's 7 pounds and 13.7 ounces. I think she already has self esteem issues about weight. It's probably because Dr. Phil has been playing on TV in the room all day. And who knows what they say to her at the nursery. 
</h3>

<h3>4/6 Day 0, 7:30pm: Those first few hours were rough where she cried and cried but after she got some nibs (my synonym for "breast feeding") she's been quiet ever since. Today is "Day 0" because she was born after midnight so that means we have two more days here if we want. We may as well stay since they check on her every few hours which is comforting.</h3>

<h3>4/6 9:31am: Getting pictures ready. Please note, for privacy, you can't send things to "baby mcgee" or any mcgee. You can only send to the room number.</h3>

<h3>4/6 6:54am: We're going to be here a few days at least. We'll let you know when we are ready for visitors. 
Pictures as soon as we get to the next room since I gotta start packing.</h3>

<h3>4/6 6:45am: Embrie is quiet for a few minutes at a time so she's probably feeling better. Sarah has several stitches but she's still bleeding.
Oh yeah, that was a lot of blood. She's not feeling well and is EXTREMELY exhausted. </h3>

<h3>4/6 6:33am: She's been crying the whole time. Her head can't feel good and it's going to be week before you can see her hair 
(if you try to peek, well, that's not cool). Her stomch is the size of a pearl so she can't be that hungry. She still has that lotion-y 
grey gue all over. They didn't even give her a bath! And she's never left the room but we're getting ready to move now.</h3>

<h3>4/6 3:45am: 8 pounds and 21 inches long. It's been a long night as you can tell. </h3>

<h3>4/6 3:40am: Dr Mayes is literally yanking on the head of Embrie-Lynn. It's insane.</h3>

<h3>4/6 3:30am: The team arrives. Once you go plunger it's high risk and could be a c-section quick. 
5-6 people plus Joan/Sarah/I are in the room</h3>

<h3>4/6 3:15am: After over 3 hours of <strike>labor</strike> pushing (the labor started at around 9am when the pitocin and regular contractions 
started) Dr. Mayes decides to go with the "plunger method" (not the official name). 
More stress on the head but the head has been under stress for 3 hours anyway.</h3>

<h3>4/6 1:11am: "I can't take the pain." And all we can do is sit here. 

<h3>4/6 1:09am: All I know is the whole "painless epidural" is BS. PLENTY of pain. Plus back pain from being in a bed all day.</h3>

And the damn blood pressure machine isn't making it any better.</h3>

<h3>4/5 10:48pm: 9cm. She gets some more meds.</h3>

<h3>4/5 10:32pm: Sherie is the new nurse. Sarah is her only patient. Probably going to increase the epidural meds . . . or start pushing. 
Gotta check the cervix.</h3>

<h3>4/5 10:29pm: Even with the epidural the pain is really bad. Every contraction every minute or two looks really painful.</h3>

<h3>4/5 10:01pm: Nurse Jen was here and Sarah was complaining about tingling on the right so 
she had her roll left because I guess the epidural moves with gravity and gets concentrated to the side you lean on.</h3>

<h3>4/5 9:39pm: Dr. Mayes is here! Checking . . . . she's 8cm. Dr Mayes says it should only a couple more hours before she starts pushing . . . then 
a few more hours maybe. And that's a quote!</h3>

<h3>4/5 9:31pm: Been a little over 6 hours since her water was broke. I consider "water broke" as 
"labor started" and it was when the painful contractions started. I'll confirm with the doctor later. 
Anyway, from what I understand, 24 hours after her water is 
broke they have to consider c-section because of worries of infection. She's half sleeping now. </h3>

<h3>4/5 9:06pm: Sarah is awake but no change. Thanks Travis for the new background! The last one was stolen and pixelated. This is much better.</h3>

<h3>4/5 8:22pm: Sarah is sleeping now. Probably going to be a while before any new updates.</h3>

<h3>4/5 7:48pm: Thanks to Joan for proofreading and being here so I have time to do this in the first place.</h3>

<h3>4/5 7:30pm: Sarah is getting sleepy and is going to take a nap. I've had more time and so I made the site bigger! 
Ctrl+Plus will make it even bigger! Oh, and I fixed the site for Firefox and IE8+ just for the people that are too scared of Google 
to use the best browser ever, <a href="https://www.google.com/chrome" target="blank">Chrome</a>.</h3>

<img src="/baby/GottaGetNailsDone800.jpg" />
<h3>4/5 7:12pm: Getting nails done in anticipation of the pictures holding the baby later that we'll be hanging up somewhere. Just shows you how relaxed she is!</h3>

<img src="/baby/NewNurseJenPosing800.jpg" />
<h3>4/5 6:59pm: Shift change for the nurses! Now we have Jen. She's nice so far. She posed for this one or was going to. 
She's gone at 2am and then Liz is back.</h3>

<h3>4/5 6:33pm: Was looking at the comments and I totally messed up the "Parenting Advice". Please re-submit! It's fixed for sure now.</h3>

<img src="/baby/Monitor800.jpg" />
<h3>4/5 6:32pm Check out the contractions! But no alarms so we have no idea what this means.</h3>

<h3>4/5 5:58pm: Dr. Mayes leaves for another call. She did her best to answer all my questions but failed.</h3>

<img src="/baby/MayesBestSide.jpg" />
<h3>4/5 5:52pm: Dr. Mayes explains that this is her better side after I took 10 other pictures.</h3>

<h3>4/5 5:50pm: New monitor so the <strong>severity</strong> of the contractions is measured, not just the duration.
 Dr. Mays explains how she just woke up from a nap so she's refreshed. She's here until 8am so we have a time limit.

<h3>4/5 5:41pm: Dr Mayes arrives!</h3>

<img src="/baby/AfterTheDrugs800.jpg" />
<h3>4/5 5:28pm: After the drugs. HAPPY SARAH!</h3>

<img src="/baby/CheerUpDrugs800.jpg" />
<h3>4/5 4:40ish: Talking about how it's going to be like someone hits you in the funny bone. </h3>

<h3>4/5 5:26pm: Sarah is happy as a clam! Can't feel contractions but they have also slowed. </h3>

<h3>4/5 5:23pm: Sarah reviews the site to make sure the pictures are okay. They are.</h3>

<h3>4/5 5:03pm: Jim gets himself banned from the site because he complained about the pictures.</h3>

<h3>4/5 4:49: Epidural in! He pumped air into the cavity of her spine to make sure it was the cavity of her spine 
(it's called the epidural space according to Joan). 
Then he threaded a little tube in there. CRAZY! Wish I could share a picture but Sarah won't let me.</h3>

<h3>4/5 4:34pm: Anesthesiologist arrives.</h3>

<img src="/baby/ContractionsChair800.jpg" />
<h3>4/5 4:28pm: Contractions last 45 seconds with a minute for a break. This is during a break. Still no epidural.</h3>

<h3>4/5 4:03pm: Kinda hungry. Might go grab a bite. It's going to be a late night. (This was a joke . . . still full from lunch 3 hours ago!)</h3>

<h3>4/5 4:00pm: Still waiting for epidural. Contractions every few minutes.</h3>

<img src="/baby/WaterBroken800.jpg" />
<h3>4/5 3:21pm: Water broken by these two. STRONGER CONTRACTIONS about 20 minutes later. Epidural on the way. (And that means no more potty breaks!)</h3>

<img src="/baby/StillNothing800.jpg" />
<h3>4/5 2:17:pm: Still nothing, 7 hours later. (In other words Travis, she's still 3 cm and and 90% effaced just like when we arrived.)</h3>

<img src="/baby/GrandmaOnSkype800.jpg" />
<h3>4/5 (Great) Grandma Ralph on Skype</h3>
